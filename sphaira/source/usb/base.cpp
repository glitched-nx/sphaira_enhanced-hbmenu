// the switch is *massively* bottlenecked by slow io (nand and sd).
// so making usb transfers zero-copy provides no benefit other than increased
// code complexity and the increase of future bugs if/when sphaira is forked
// an changes are made.
// yati already goes to great lengths to be zero-copy during installing
// by swapping buffers and inflating in-place.

// NOTE: it is now possible to request the transfer buffer using GetTransferBuffer(),
// which will always be aligned and have the size aligned.
// this allows for zero-copy transferrs to take place.
// this is used in usb_upload.cpp.
// do note that this relies of the host sending / receiving buffers of an aligned size.
